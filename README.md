# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

I have made an app which gets you a random friends quote when you shake your phone!

This was made using React, Styled Components and React Native.

## The problem

This week motivation has been a problem. I felt that the project was big and I didn't know what to do. But once I felt that I had an idea I just went for it. And now in the end I feel really happy about it!
